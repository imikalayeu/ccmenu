High-priority Stories
=====================

#26 Exclude projects from aggregation to status bar item: As a developer I want to exclude projects that are visible in the menu from the aggregation to the status bar item so that the status bar item provides information about the project I care about most but I can still keep an eye on other projects in the menu.          

#29 Sort projects: As a developer I would like to change the order in which projects are displayed so that I can see the projects that are most important to me quickly. [Maybe have two sections; anything "below the line" would be excluded from aggregation (see #26).]

#27 Display project status heatmap in status item: As a developer I wangt to see the status of multiple projects in the status bar item so that I can have a detailed view without opening the menu or window.

#25 Publish notification if current build time exceeds last build time by x: As a developer I want CCMenu to notify me (via Growl) if the current build time exceeds the last build time by a margin that I can configure so that I am alerted as soon as possible about a build that might be stuck.


Low-priority Stories
====================

#30 Auto start: As a developer I would like to set CCMenu to start at login in the CCMenu preference so that I don't have to go to the system preferences, or know about them. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/815063/how-do-you-make-your-app-open-at-login [Can be done from Dock and in System Preferences.]

#21 Force build: As a developer I want to e able to force a build from the project window so that I do not have to go to the dashboard for this operation. [Few servers support this.] 

#22 Selectable columns: As a developer I want to configure which columns are visible in the project window so that I can see the information that is most relevant to me. [Project window not used much?]

#23 Absolute build time format: As a developer I want to set the format in which the last build times are displayed so that I can see relevant information in the format that suits me best.


Internal Bugs
=============

- build status change notifications sent during event handling
- many strings not localizable
